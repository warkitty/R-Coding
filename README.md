## I have been learning R and want to share what I have been doing and my results. This is absolutely basic. This is coding for beginners and is not optimal and can therefore be improved. 

My biggest project in R is regarding globl warming and the effect cars have contributed.
Global warming has become a major problem. It endangers our health, national security and threatens other basic human needs. In fact, record high temperatures, rising seas, severe flooding, and droughtsâ€”are already increasingly common. This has become a global problem and one of our biggest concerns. 

Did you know that our personal vehicles are a major cause of global warming! 
In the US alone, nearly one-fifth of all emissions are from cars and trucks. [ucsusa, 07.18.2014](ucsusa.org/resources/car-emissions-global-warming)

### Review of findings 
**To reduce the damage and slow the process of global warming, there is a need to look at potential ways to reduce the amount of emissions**. We discovered that **Norway is the number 1 user of electric cars**, and 9.3% percent of all cars on the road are fully electric. We wanted to look over to our friends in the north and see what they are doing as early adopters in the market of e-cars.

1) Norway has been the second most important market for **Tesla Motors** (after the United States) in September 2016.
2) Over **99%** of the electricity production in mainland Norway is from hydropower plants. 
3) Although Norway is one of the largest producers and exporters of Oil, they remain a leading country in the electrification of its transport sector, having the largest fleet of electric vehicles per capital in the world in the oil industry.

Electric vehicles (EV), by limitation, are better suited for the city. Long Road trips may be challenging due to the vehicle's low range and limited charging infrastructure. In fact, a trip that was supposed to take 10 hours round trip took 35 hours round trip, where 19 of those were spent at a charging station.

Cars manufactured by Tesla are the exception because it has its own developed charging infrastructure, whereas all the other companies rely on the public/private investors. 

Think about how when Ford invented the model Ford T and automobiles were streamlined and mass sold. Ford didn't have to worry about building the highways or the gas stations to charge the cars; the state/big oil companies took care of that.
